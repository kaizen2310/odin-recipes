    <h2>Description</h2>
    <P>Kothimbir Vadi is a crispy and flavorful Maharashtrian snack made from besan (gram flour) and fresh coriander leaves. The batter, infused with spices like turmeric, cumin, and sesame seeds, is first steamed to form a solid block and then sliced into pieces, which are shallow or deep-fried until crispy. The vadis have a deliciously nutty and earthy flavor with a slight crunch. This dish is a perfect tea-time snack and can be served with green chutney or ketchup. It is often enjoyed as an appetizer or side dish in Maharashtrian households.</P>
