    <h2>Description</h2>
    <P>Puran Poli is a traditional Maharashtrian sweet flatbread made during festivals like Gudi Padwa, Holi, and Diwali. The dish consists of a soft wheat flour dough stuffed with a sweet filling made of cooked chana dal (Bengal gram) and jaggery, flavored with cardamom and nutmeg. Once rolled out, the poli is cooked on a hot tawa with ghee, giving it a soft yet slightly crispy texture. It is often served with warm milk, a dollop of ghee, or even amti (spicy dal) in some regions. This delicacy has a rich, comforting sweetness and a melt-in-the-mouth texture.    </P>
